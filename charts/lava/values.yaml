# Persistence
# Persistence configuration
# NOTE: LAVA requires shared storage across multiple pods (server, publisher, worker)
# - Single-node clusters (minikube, dev): ReadWriteOnce works fine
# - Multi-node clusters (production): Requires ReadWriteMany
#
# For multi-node ReadWriteMany storage, consider:
# - AWS: EFS CSI driver with storageClass: "efs-sc"
# - Azure: Azure Files with storageClass: "azurefile"
# - GCP: Filestore CSI driver
# - On-premises: NFS, Ceph, or similar shared storage
persistence:
  enabled: false  # Disabled by default - enable based on your cluster topology
  storageClass: ""  # Use default for single-node, specify RWX storage class for multi-node
  accessMode: ReadWriteOnce  # Change to ReadWriteMany for multi-node clusters
